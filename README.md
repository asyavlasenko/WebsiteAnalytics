# ðŸ“Š Visitors CLI App

## About the Project

This is a simple command-line application written in **C++** that reads and analyzes two CSV files representing user visits on two separate days.  
The goal is to identify users who visited **new products** on the **second day** that they did **not visit on the first day**.

## Description

Welcome to **New Product Visitors CLI App**!  
This tool compares user-product interactions across two days to help track **new interest in products**.  
It identifies each userâ€™s new product visits on the second day that were **not seen on the first day**, making it useful for marketing, recommendation systems, or churn detection.

## How to Run

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o website main.cpp
./website
```

### Time Complexity (Big O):

- Reading CSV files: `O(N + M)`  
- Where `N` = number of lines in Day 1 file, `M` = lines in Day 2 file  
- Set lookups for previous visits: `O(1)` per check  
- Overall runtime: **O(N + M)**

This approach ensures efficiency even with large input files by using hash-based data structures like `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` for fast lookup.
